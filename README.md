# BusFairPayment

In this project you can pay the public transport fair in online by scanning a QR code which is in front of you. Primarily after scanning you have to 
select your destination and starting place then the fair will calculate autometically. If you are a student then the fair will autometically calculate by 50% discount.

In future, this place choosing procedure will be autometically calculated by sensor with co-op of robotics.
